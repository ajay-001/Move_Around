Move_Around
===========

A page that allows the user to move around fluidly.

Scrollbars have been removed to give the user a sense of a wide,open landscape.

The user can still navigate with arrow keys and a mousewheel('for vertical scrolling only').

Created by using jQuery's *animate* method with 'scrollTop' and 'scrollLeft' parameters. 

Uses nicescroll (http://areaaperta.com/nicescroll/).
